From searching for restaurants to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem where actions bring about unknown rewards and costs. Although these search problems are omnipresent in our daily lives, we still don't fully understand the mechanisms of  human functional learning. Especially when considering derivative information. 

The goal of this project is to investigate and model the way in which humans search, and why we chose to search the way we do. I chose to frame this in a 1D search problem, as its simplicity allows a greater focus on the basic search mechanisms that humans employ, and would allow more noise free comparison between gradient and non-gradient conditions. The experiment is a active function learning task to find the global maxima of a set of unknown functions, taking participants from Mturk.
